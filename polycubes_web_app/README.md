Josh's version of Joakim Bohlin's polycubes web app. Copied from https://github.com/sulcgroup/polycubes-clone on 10 March 2025, commit `a5ecb600dfc90586a62ea8523675da1eea93ab25`

This folder contains the files and build information for the Polycubes Stochastic Assembler website.

To set up the stochastic assembler, install npm and then run `npm install` to automatically download the required packages. You can then run `npm run build` to compile and parcel the code into the `./dist` directory. Run a server with the server root in `./dist` and open `localhost:myserverport/index.html` or `localhost:myserverport/solve.html` to run the website.
