An interactive  Polycubes Stochastic Assembler: a GUI for polycube design and in-browser simulation. 

To set up the stochastic assembler, install npm and then run `npm install` to automatically download the required packages. You can then run `npm run build` to compile and parcel the code into the `./dist` directory. Run a server with the server root in `./dist` and open `localhost:myserverport/index.html` or `localhost:myserverport/solve.html` to run the website.
