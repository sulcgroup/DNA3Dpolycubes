# DNA3Dpolycubes
A repository accompanying a manuscript *Universal 3D Nanoscale Assembly with DNA Polycubes*. It contains software tools that are used for design and simulation-driven validation of self-assembled polycube finite-sized as well crystal structures and their subsequent export to DNA strands for experimental realization. It consists of the following tools:

## Polycubes stochastic assembly on lattice simulator
The [Polycube C++ stochastic lattice](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/polycubes_cpp) simulation program that is used to validate candidate rules generated by the SAT solver

## Polycubes SAT problem
The [generator](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/polycubes_sat) of SAT formulation of the polycube design

## Polycubes web app
The [Polycubes web application](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/polycubes_web_app) is a graphic user interface for design and assembly of polycubes structures and run their stochastic assembly algorithm in JavaScript.

## SEDesign: DNA sequence design algorithm
The [sticky end design algorithm](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/SEdesign) that designs orthogonal DNA interaction intefaces on DNA cube blocks.

## RigidDNA
A [rigid body coarse-grained molecular dynamics algorithm](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/rigidDNA) used for pre-relaxation of large (up to several millions of nucleotides) structures before their validation in oxDNA model

## oxDNA 
A [modified version of oxDNA](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/oxDNA) simulation code with custom modifications to support simulations of large DNA nanotechnology systems exceeding three million nucleotides

## Pypatchy
[Python script library](https://github.com/sulcgroup/DNA3Dpolycubes/tree/main/pypatchy) for manipulation and analysis of patchy particle simulations of structures.
