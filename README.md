# DNA3Dpolycubes
A repository accompanying a manuscript *Universal 3D Nanoscale Assembly with DNA Polycubes*. It contains software tools that are used in the manuscript for design and simulation-driven validation of polycube self-assembled polycube finite-sized as well crysal structures and their subsequent export to DNA strands for experimental realization.  

## Polycubes cpp
The Polycube C++ stochastic lattice simulation program that is used to validate candidate rules generated by the SAT solver

## Polycubes SAT problem
The generator of SAT formulation of the polycube design

## Polycubes web app
The polycubes web application is a graphic user interface for design and assembly of polycubes structures. 

## Sequence design algorithm
The sticky end design algorithm that designs orthogonal DNA interaction intefaces on DNA cube blocks.

## RigidDNA
A coarse-grained molecular dynamics algorithm used for pre-relaxation of large (up to several millions of nucleotides) structures before their validation in oxDNA model

## oxDNA 
A modified version of oxDNA simulation code with custom modifications to support simulations of large DNA nanotechnology systems exceeding three million nucleotides

## ipy_oxDNA 
Python script library for manipulation of oxDNA structures. These libraries are required for setting up oxDNA simulations and conversion of simulation-validated
