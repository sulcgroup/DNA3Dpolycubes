## polycubes cpp
The polycube C++ program was used to validate candidate rules generated by the SAT solver

## polycubes SAT problem
This version of the polycubes SAT formulation was written by Joakim Bohlin

## polycubes web app
The polycubes web application is a graphic user interface for design and assembly of polycubes structures. It was originally coded by Joakim Bohlin but the version included here was heavily updated by Joshua Evans to add a lot of visualization and design tools.

## SEDesign
The sticky end design script was written by Hao Liu and Matthew Sample. Hao wrote code to generate sets of sequences that form dimers with a desired melting temperature, Matt wrote a program to screen the sequences for cross-talking interactions

## ipy_oxDNA (TODO)
Library was mainly written by Matthew Sample. Relevant here, it includes code for manipulating oxDNA structure pythonically, written by Joshua Evans. This code is required for the pypatchy
