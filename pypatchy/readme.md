PyPatchy
========
Python package for setting up, managing, and running patchy particle simulations. This package does not contain a patchy particle model implementation and is designed to work with the patchy particle models in the [romano](../oxDNA/contrib/romano) and [rovigatti](../oxDNA/contrib/rovigatti) oxDNA implementations.

Any questions about pypatchy should be directed to [Joshua Evans](mailto:jrevan21@asu.edu).


## Intallation
Requirements for constructing a pypatchy conda or mamba environment are listed in `pypatchy.yml`. 

You can then install pypatchy via pip:
```bash
pip install .
```

PyPatchy requires [ipy_oxDNA](../ipy_oxDNA), which is also included in this repository.

## Usage
Brief descriptions of all modules in this package can be found in the [pypatchy](pypatchy) code source directory and its subdirectories.
